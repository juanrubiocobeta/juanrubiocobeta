# Hi, my name is Juan Rubio Cobeta

I'm a **Mathematics graduate** based in Zaragoza, Spain, currently applying my analytical skills at a local bank.

I specialize in data analysis and predictive modeling, with a passion for transforming complex data into practical solutions using `Python`, `R`, and `SQL`. I'm always looking for new challenges where I can solve real-world problems.

I'm passionate about data science, machine learning, and especially their use in finance, which fuels my drive to keep learning. These projects are the result: hands-on work I've done on my own to apply and master the theory as I go.

While I've only recently begun showcasing my projects on GitHub, this portfolio is actively growing. I am committed to consistently adding new work as I learn and apply new skills.
