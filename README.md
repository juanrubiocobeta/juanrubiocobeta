# Hi, my name is Juan Rubio Cobeta

I'm a **Mathematics graduate** based in Zaragoza, Spain, currently applying my analytical skills at a local bank.

I specialize in data analysis and predictive modeling, with a passion for transforming complex data into practical solutions using `Python`, `R`, and `SQL`. I'm always looking for new challenges where I can solve real-world problems.

I'm passionate about data science, machine learning, and especially their use in finance, which fuels my drive to keep learning. These projects are the result: hands-on work I've done on my own to apply and master the theory as I go.

While I've only recently begun showcasing my projects on GitHub, this portfolio is actively growing. I am committed to consistently adding new work as I learn and apply new skills.

## Featured Projects

### 1. S&P 500 Predictive Analysis (with R)
* **Description:** An iterative analysis to forecast the monthly direction of the S&P 500 using **Random Forest**. This project demonstrates a robust modeling process, from feature engineering (creating momentum and moving averages) to validating directional accuracy (66.5%).
* **Tech:** `R`, `randomForest`, `dplyr`, `TTR`.

### 2. Stock Price Forecasting with LSTMs (with Python)
* **Description:** An implementation of an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network to predict stock closing prices. The project includes a rigorous data preprocessing workflow for time-series, preventing data leakage, and model building with Keras/TensorFlow.
* **Tech:** `Python`, `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`.
